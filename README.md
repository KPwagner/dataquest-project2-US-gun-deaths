# Dataquest Guided Project 2: Exploring Gun Deaths in the U.S.
This Jupyter Notebook (US_gun_deaths.ipynb) and two datasets (guns.csv, census.csv) are from the Python Programming: Intermediate section of Dataquest's Data Analyst path. The Jupyter Notebook shows the analysis I performed using these datasets. Since Jupyter Notebooks render as HTML on Github, you can't interact with the Notebook unless you download the files.
